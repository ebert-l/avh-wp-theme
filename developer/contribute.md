# Contribution Guidelines
All the work on this theme should be done acording to the [Wordpress Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/).
If there are procedures where we diverge from the official guidelines, we will try to fix this later on.

## Branches
Every Developer should have his own Branch `<name>` on which they develop and test their work.
The devs should then open feature branches that are clearly mapped to the user and the feature that is being developed.
Like `simon-styleUpdates`.
If everything is properly tested the developers work will be merged in the branch `dev`.

Noone should ever work on the branch dev or master directly!

After testing everything on the branch `dev` the results will be merged in the `main` branch.
